## Tech Stack
| Layers | Technology |
|--------|------------|
| Frontend | Vite, React |
| Backend | Node.js, Express |
| AI | Anthropic SDK | 
| Styling | CSS |
| Deployment | Render (frontend + backend )

## Architecture
```
User (React Frontend)
  - Adds ingredients and clicks "Get a Recipe"
        ↓
Express Backend (Node.js)
  - Receives ingredients via POST /api/recipe
  - Passes ingredients to Anthropic SDK
  - API key stays server-side (never exposed to client)
        ↓
Anthropic Claude API
  - Generates a recipe based on the ingredients
  - Returns markdown-formatted response
        ↓
React Frontend
  - Renders the recipe using ReactMarkdown
  - Saves current recipe to localStorage

Frontend and backend are deployed as separate services on Render.

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- An Anthropic API key ([get one here](https://platform.claude.com/dashboard))

### Steps

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/btallakson27/Chef-Claude
cd Chef-Claude
```

2. Install frontend dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Install backend dependencies
```bash
cd server
npm install
cd ..
```

4. Create a `.env` file inside the `server` folder
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

5. Start the backend server
```bash
cd server
node index.js
```

6. In a separate terminal, start the frontend
```bash
npm run dev
```

7. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Your secret key from the Anthropic console |

Environment variables are stored in a `.env` file that is never commited to GitHub (it is listed in `.gitignore`). This keeps your API key secure and off of version control. On Render, environment variables are set dieectly in the service dashboard. 

---

## Deployment

Both the frontend and backend are deployed on [Render](https://render.com).

- The **backend** runs ass a Node.js web service and exposes a single endpoint: `POST /api/recipe`
- The **frontend** os built with `npm run build` and served as a static site
- CORS is configured on the backend to only accept requests from the deployed frontend URL

---

## Known Limitations
- The Render free tier spins down after inactivity — the first request after a period of no use may take 30–60 seconds while the server wakes up
- Saved recipes are stored in localStorage, meaning they are device and browser specific — clearing browser data will remove them
- There is currently no user authentication, so saved recipes are not synced across devices
- Ingredient list resets on page refresh — only the generated recipe persists
